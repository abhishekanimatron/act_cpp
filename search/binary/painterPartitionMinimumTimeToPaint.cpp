// We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2â€¦An}. There are k painters available and each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of board. The problem is to find the minimum time to get
// this job done under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards, say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.

// Input : k = 2, A = {10, 10, 10, 10}
// Output : 20.
// Here we can divide the boards into 2
// equal sized partitions, so each painter
// gets 20 units of board and the total
// time taken is 20.

// Input : k = 2, A = {10, 20, 30, 40}
// Output : 60.
// Here we can divide first 3 boards for
// one painter and the last board for
// second painter.

// Possible divisions are:

// * One partition: so time is 100.

// * Two partitions: (10) & (20, 30, 40), so time is 90. Similarly we can put the first divider
// after 20 (=> time 70) or 30 (=> time 60); so this means the minimum time: (100, 90, 70, 60) is 60.
